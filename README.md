Replication files for this Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-science-regression-competition-spring-2023/.
Final ensemble model predictions can be replicated by running scripts 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 15, 19, 20, 22b, and lines 1-7, 125, and 131-132 of script 23. 
Stacking coefficients from 22a are saved and uploaded to allow for an abbreviated replication of results. Replication of ensemble tuning process also requires
scripts 12, 18, 22a.
